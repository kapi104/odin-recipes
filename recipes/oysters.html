    <h1>Rockin' Oysters Rockefeller</h1>
    <img src="../img/oysters.jpg" alt="oysters" width="500px" height="350px">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Oysters Rockefeller consists of oysters on the half-shell that have been topped with a rich sauce of butter,
        parsley and other green herbs, and bread crumbs, then baked or broiled. Lemon wedges are the typical garnish.
    </p>
    <p>The original sauce may or may not include spinach, a popular shortcut for achieving the dish's signature bright
        green color. Many contemporary adaptations use diced oysters instead of whole. Also, diced bacon often appears
        as a non-traditional topping in addition to or in place of the sauce.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>48 fresh, unopened oysters</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups beer</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic </li>
        <li>seasoned salt to taste </li>
        <li>7 black peppercorns </li>
        <li>½ cup butter </li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped </li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed </li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained </li>
        <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded </li>
        <li>8 ounces fontina cheese, shredded </li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded </li>
        <li>½ cup milk </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fine bread crumbs </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean oysters, and place in a large stockpot. Pour in beer and enough water to cover oysters; add 2 cloves
            garlic, seasoned salt, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat, drain, and cool.</li>
        <li>Once oysters are cooled, break off and discard the top shell. Arrange the oysters on a baking sheet. Preheat
            oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic in butter until soft. Reduce heat to low,
            and stir in spinach, Monterey Jack, fontina, and mozzarella. Cook until cheese melts, stirring frequently.
            Stir in the milk, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over each oyster, just filling the shell.
            Sprinkle with bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden and bubbly, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
